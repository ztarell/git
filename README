All programs written by Zachary Tarell

I encourage anyone viewing this to open and pay attention to each README file inside the folders for explanations and warnings (i.e. Linux tarball)!


For read only use and trust that all contents will be viewed only by  git-master invited parties and/or anyone without content of theft or prejudice.

Some programs may not debug or compile due to unfinished work or library/class linking with some projects containing more than one program inside.

For any information or suggestions please feel free to contact me.
