					Lane Johnson's Suspension
				</p>
				<p class="words">
					Lane Johnson <em>finally</em> gets suspended for 10 games after first hearing of the failed drug test back in training camp. This is his <em>second</em> suspension for PED use so it is doubtful his appeal will be granted. He claims it is an <q>over-the-counter supplement,</q> but this is now sounding more and more like a trend. Most importantly for Eagles fans is the fact that he signed a big extension in the off-season to be the future at left tackle and now it appears he can't be trusted to be available. <span class="date"> 9/20/16</span>

					Wentz-ylvania!
				</p>
				<p class="words">
					The unlikely ascent of <em>Carson Wentz</em> from small school question mark to undefeated rookie continues. The most amazing feat in this unlikely start for the second overall pick in the draft is the fact that the offense has zero turnovers in these first two games. The second most important fact may be his success against the blitz. These two items are at the top of every defensive coordinator's list when they face a rookie QB. Eagles fans don't know whether to cheer or shut the hell up knowing the other shoe has to drop. He has certainly outperformed all expectations so far. <span class="date"> 9/21/16</span>
