<h2 class="notesh2">Zach's Crack On What's Whack</h2>
<p class="notes">Obviously I can't talk about what's wrong with our team without talking about Nelson Agholor. Yep, he's a giant turd and we all know it. In fact, everyone in the world seems to know it except for Chip Kelly. Remeber Chip-adelphia? Yea, me either. And, if we don't do something drastic to fix this receiver situation, you're gonna forget Wentzylvania was a thing, too! It's not just the dropped passes - it's the penalties and the money we have to pay this &quot;first&quot; round pick as well as his inability to get open... LIKE AT ALL! My daughter can cover this guy and I don't even have a daughter, yet. Him and his corp are making Carson Wentz look like a rookie from North Dakota State. Come on, Pederson! Schwartz can't hide your flaws forever, so, 'till next week - Go Birds!</p>
