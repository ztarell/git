All websites were written from scratch with HTML and CSS (no Wordpress, Dreamweaver, etc. help).

Eagles - For school project

Red Gravy Productions - was for personal use (do not own domain name anymore).

Extra:
DynamicIPsolutions.net was a website I created for a client outside of school and used WordPress.
