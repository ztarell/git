All websites were written from scratch with HTML and CSS (exception: Dynamic IP Solutions was with WordPress).

www.ZachTarell.com - My Web Resume and built with latest version of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - Using Boostrap Framework  

Eagles - For school project

Red Gravy Productions - was for personal use (do not own domain name anymore).

DynamicIPSolutions.net was a website I created for a client outside of school and used WordPress.
